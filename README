# openstreetmap-api-testsuite #

Integration tests for your OSM API code

## About ##
This test suite consists of a series of tests to validate that your OSM API implementation produces the correct results.

There are two parts to the test suite, an OSM XML file to be loaded into the API to be tested, and a gatling test file that specifies the tests.

## Requirements ##

* [gatling](http://gatling-tool.org/) 2.0.0-M3a or later

* The API you want to test, as well as whatever it requires to load the data.

## Usage ##

In ``gatling-charts-highcharts-2.0.0-M3a/user-files/simulations/`` clone the git repo with

```
git clone https://github.com/pnorman/openstreetmap-api-testsuite
```

1. Load data.xml into the database + API of your choice

2. Apply diff.xml to the database

3. Edit the base URL in the OpenStreetMapApiTest.scala file.

4. Run gatling
